# Iris Flower Classification
This project focuses on the classification of Iris flower species using machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species: Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor, and Iris-virginica.

# Dataset
The dataset is provided in the iris.csv file and includes the following features:

Id: Identifier for each row
SepalLengthCm: Sepal length in centimeters
SepalWidthCm: Sepal width in centimeters
PetalLengthCm: Petal length in centimeters
PetalWidthCm: Petal width in centimeters
Species: The species of the iris flower

# Models
Three different machine learning models were trained on this dataset to achieve the best possible prediction accuracy. Each model was evaluated, and all achieved an accuracy of 100% on the test data. The models used are:

Model 1: Support Vector Machine
Model 2: Logistic Regression
Model 3: Decision Tree Classifier

# Results
All three models achieved 100% accuracy on the test data, indicating perfect classification performance for the given dataset.

# Files
iris.csv: The dataset used for training and evaluation
Iris_Classification.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different machine learning models on the Iris dataset, achieving perfect classification accuracy. It serves as a foundational example for those interested in learning about machine learning and classification tasks.
